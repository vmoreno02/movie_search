This project is for the OIT coding challenge. It's a simple app that uses a Vue frontend and a Node backend to access the Movie Database and search for movies.

Things to fix:
- The backend does not work when you press the enter button on the keyboard instead of the search button
- Right now, the backend runs on localhost:3002 and the frontend runs on localhost:3000. This introduces CORS issues. In Chrome, the only way to resolve this is with an extension that can allow CORS.

Things to add in the future:
- Save searches
